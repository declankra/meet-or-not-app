## What is it?
A tool to help you create productive meetings

Technically: a web app that uses react state logic to decide if a meeting is necessary, and if it is, call a custom OpenAI prompt to generate an agenda for you

## Roadmap

- play around with some cool UI libraries to make websiter cooler + learn new libraries
